# PHP Container for Dogs

Create PHP micro-services that we can use for developments at Dogstudio.

You can use this containter directly with `php56-apache` and `php7-apache` tags.
Or with a web proxy, like `nginx` with `php56-fpm` and `php7-fpm` tags.

## Xdebug

These container are configured to provide `xdebug` support with _"PHP Storm"_.
